LB source:
	class Orchestrator:
		container parmeters
		strategy

		container count -> Observable
		notify -> container count changes,

		Object Pool -> containers stored by id

		docker stats: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/stats/
		states are updated by a daemon thread.

		handlers for strategy changes:
			strategem/loadbalancing/<name>
			strategem/scaling/<name>

		Constructor():
			get docker image
			initialize minimum contaniner objects
			create container_count as observable


		make it a singleton

	class Container:

	interface for strategy: concrete-ify for scaling and load balancing

	TBFO: How does concrete strategy interact with container count and object pool


Separate design pattern classes:
	Observable, Strategy, State?
